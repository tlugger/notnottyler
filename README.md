# Personal Site

I'm not not Tyler. An engineer who's gotten slightly too comfortable with the back-end. So I'm gonna try boosting my front-end skills. Design? Bit of a work in progress. Code quality? Getting better every day. Cheesy programming puns? Never ending!

After a few iterations of this I decided that I don't need to use the latest and greatest front end framework but have decided to go back to the basics. All I should need is an `index.html` file and a single CSS file. My goal overtime is to minimize the total size of this directory (minus the assets maybe) to keep things as simple as possible.


```python
>>> Not Not 'Tyler'
True
