I want what every other Computer Science student wants. To create, host, and distribute my own personal website without spending a dime! And I think I've done it, thanks to a lot of help from student discounts and specials. I've had a personal website before, in fact I think it's still up on [heroku](http://tylerlugger.herokuapp.com/)! All built on a big ruby on rails framework that I knew nothing about. But today things change.

It all started with the domain name. Thanks to the free domain code for domain.com from a school hackathon, and a little smart-assed thinking, I had it. [notnottyler.com](http://notnottyler.com). Next was the challenge of developing the website. I couldn't afford a full scale CMS or web app. I needed something static that would allow me to host without compute cost. I tried another ruby based framework, [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Cool, but I wouldn't use Ruby too much outside of this site. Then a server-rendered, complicated to configure for my use, [next.js](https://zeit.co/blog/next). But I finally landed here, with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). After stealing an example project from their repo, I was up and running on GitHub Pages!

Where next? I'm not sure. The main purpose of this site will be to keep a 'live' resume so I can give anyone the link to my site. I hope to also add some front-end projects/experiments. I need the experience and I like having this as my platform for it. And then the blog. It came with the "stolen" Gatsby project so I might keep it up! For reference, most of my writing (and cool IoT projects) happen at work on the [niolabs blog](https://niolabs.com/blog). But this can be the place for my own thought bubbles. We shall see!
