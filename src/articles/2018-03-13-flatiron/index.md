description: "Mostly my time to reflect"
---

I've been through rejection a lot throughout my life. I've been turned down for dates or jobs but this is a bit different. I'm not sure what the point of this one is yet but I kinda see it as a post mortem for our NVC Semifinals pitch. I've had less than 24 hours to reflect on this myself so buckle up!

This was rejection for an idea/passion I've developed over the course of seven months as of writing this. Our startup/application/solution Flatiron. The idea still makes so much sense to me. A bit of an Analytics as a Service platform providing not only the data but the analysis that everyone can use. And over the course of the past week, we've really refined this idea into something that can work. I don't mean this idea became real over the past week but we've put HOURS into this idea over one week to have the pitch clean and sparkly.

We have gone past so many practice judging rounds and we consistently get the same feedback. It's a great idea and we've clearly done our homework. Practicing as a team, we have perfected the pitch to run for just under 5 minutes. Literally 4 minutes and 58 seconds of information, research, and our proposed solution. But in the end it didn't win us the spot in the NVC Finals. Bummer, but it's not the end for Flatiron. There are so many possible reasons for why we might not have made it this time through. Obviously we went up against some good teams but I was confident that we had the better idea. Founder blindness? Could be. We also just didn't resonate with this round of judges. In every pitch up to this point, our feedback from professors and entrepreneurship experts has always been mostly positive. We even created a handful of backup slides for questions we expected to get. But in this case we were met with more criticism than questions. Can't win them all.

Entrepreneurs will hear "NO" dozens or even hundreds of times before someone else believes in their idea. I'm sure there will be no acception for Flatiron. None the less, I'm using this as a learning opportunity. An experience for receiving rejection and moving past it. It is still a solution that I believe in and I'm willing to continue working it this when I have the time to make the idea a reality.
