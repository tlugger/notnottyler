### Flatiron

*Shared Experience Platform*

The Flatiron Platform is a startup that I co-founded during my Senior Capstone class. At the highest level, we provide a service similar to Google Analytics for physical locations. The platform consists of a mobile application. This provides an augmented form of visitor information and communication for the attendees of an event. The other end of the platform provides an interface for event coordinators and venues to consume and analyze their physical space analytics.


### Facial Recognition
