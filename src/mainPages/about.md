About Me
========

I am Software Engineer with a hunger to learn and improve. I have several years of experience in full stack development through professional, academic, and personal projects. However, I am always working on growing myself professionally and holding onto the passion I have for the software field.

Projects
--------

### Flatiron

*Shared Experience Platform*

The Flatiron Platform is a startup that I co-founded during my Senior Capstone class. At the highest level, we provide a service similar to Google Analytics for physical locations. The platform consists of a mobile application. This provides an augmented form of visitor information and communication for the attendees of an event. The other end of the platform provides an interface for event coordinators and venues to consume and analyze their physical space analytics.

See our mockups and more at [FlatironApp.com](https://flatironapp.com).

### Informant

*Big Data Sentiment Analysis*

This project was completed during my Big Data Analysis and Design class taught by the Director of Engineering at Twitter in Boulder. Informant was a web application built using the Twitter Streaming API, SocketIO, Python, React JS, Apache Storm, and Apache Kafka. By the end of this project, we were able to collect and display a live comparison of sentiment about 8 unicorn companies through live tweets.

See our project source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/tlugger/informant).
